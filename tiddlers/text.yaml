    !! About

    MPTW5 is a lightly customized "edition" of TiddlyWiki. The "Tagging" list
    below shows a list of the substantial tweaks and customizations, and serves
    as a quick demo of how MPTW5 works. Notice each tiddler in that list is
    tagged with "MPTW5", which is what makes it appear in the "Tagging" list.

    MPTW5 is created and maintained by [[Simon Baird|http://simonbaird.com/]],
    and is the spiritual successor to [[MPTW|http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/]].

    !! Configuration

    As well as the layout customizations there are some config changes, in
    particular to disable CamelCase linking, and to select my preferred tools,
    toolbar items, and color scheme.

    You can adjust this configuration to suit your preferences in the
    [[ControlPanel|$:/ControlPanel]]. You can also click
    <span style="font-size:150%;">{{$:/core/ui/Buttons/palette}}</span>
    to try different color schemes. See [[GettingStarted]] for some other
    basic configuration options.

    It is recommended to keep the "new here" button in your Tiddler view toolbar.
    Onw of the key MPTW5 concepts is that tagging lists help you maintain your content
    in an easy to navigate, hierarchical structure based on tags. This makes the
    "new here" button work as a kind of "create child page" function.
