      I prefer having the sidebar tabs reset to their defaults every time
      rather than remember their state on save, particularly when you have the
      long list of shadow tiddlers open.

      This technique is based on:
      https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/prevent-state-from-being-saved/5162/3

      Beware you can trash your TiddlyWiki pretty hard if you make a mistake
      in this filter and then save, so be careful here.

    <!--
      This should be tagged with $:/tags/ViewTemplate so it is included in the
      layout for every tiddler. Its purpose is to always show a list of tiddlers that
      are tagged with this tiddler at the bottom of the tiddler view. It's inspired by
      the old MPTW, see at http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/ .

      This pairs well with the "new here" button and the "new journal here" button
      which can be enabled in the Appearance/Toolbars section of the Control Panel.

    !! About

    MPTW5 is created and maintained by [[Simon Baird|http://simonbaird.com/]]
    and is the spiritual successor to [[MPTW|http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/]]. It
    began as a way to demonstrate the new [[templates feature|https://tiddlyhost.com/hub?t=1]]
    on [[Tiddlyhost|https://tiddlyhost.com]], but now it has its own life as a place
    to share my preferred TiddlyWiki setup.

    The "Tagging" list below shows a list of the substantial customizations,
    and serves as a quick demo of how MPTW5 works. Notice each tiddler in that
    list is tagged with "MPTW5", which is what makes it appear there.

    As well as the layout customizations there are some config changes, in
    particular to disable CamelCase linking, select my preferred tools, toolbar
    items, and palette. You can adjust this configuration to suit your own
    preference in the [[ControlPanel|$:/ControlPanel]]. See also
    [[GettingStarted]] for some other basic configuration options.

    One thing I do recommend is to keep the "new here" button in your Tiddler
    view toolbar. The main idea behind MPTW5 is that tagging lists help you
    maintain your content in an easy to navigate, hierarchical structure based
    on tags. This makes the "new here" button work as a kind of "create child
    page" function.

    (If you use this template for your own TiddlyWiki feel free to delete this
    tiddler.)

    <!--
      This button is similar to the save button, but it will always download a
      copy of the entire TiddlyWiki, even if another save method is available.
      This is useful on Tiddlyhost when you want to download, since the regular
      save button will always do a save to Tiddlyhost. Unlike the regular save
      button, it doesn't show any indication when a save is needed.

      Todo in future maybe:
      - Suppress or change the "Saved wiki" notification
      - Make it so the strings can be translated
      - Propose adding it to the core TiddlyWiki5
