# MPTW5

Source code and tooling for maintaining MPTW5, a custom
[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) template. Motivated in particular by the
need to automate upgrading and syncing the two different versions of MPTW5.

You can preview and use MPTW5 on
[Tiddlyhost](https://tiddlyhost.com/hub/user/Simon?t=1). Click the "Clone"
button to create a Tiddlyhost site using one of the MPTW5 template.

See the [About MPTW5](https://mptw5x.tiddlyhost.com/#About%20MPTW5) page for
